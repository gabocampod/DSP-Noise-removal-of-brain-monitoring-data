# DSP-Noise-removal-of-brain-monitoring-data
Algorithms for noise removal in brain monitoring data.

EEG brain monitoring data corrupted by non-linear noise was made available to this project. three algorithms were implemented to clean the signals, these are:
1. Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD)
2. Superposition of Moving Averages (SMA)
3. Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA)

the algorithms presented in this repository were coded from scratch in Python and Matlab. 

The raw data including 40-minute-long sessions on real patients are also made available. 

feel free to contact me if you would like to collaborate or make use of this project.
